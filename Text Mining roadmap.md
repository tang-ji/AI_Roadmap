- [ ] Word2Vec CBOW Skip-gram

  continuous bag-of-words: a text is represented as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.

  Skip-gram: a generalization of n-grams in which the components need not be consecutive in the text under consideration, but may leave gaps that are *skipped* over. (skip 1 gram 2)

  CBOW faster, skip-gram better job for infrequent words

- [ ] Glove

   achieved by mapping words into a meaningful space where the distance between words is related to semantic similarity. 

- [ ] FastText

- [ ] Co-Occurrences shifted PPMI
